			<h1>About</h1>
			<p class="wcont">Founded in 1997, Hans Dairy is one of the
				largest Ontario businesses that specialize in South Asian dairy
				products. From the very beginning, our mission is to offer dairy
				products that provide our customers with a little taste of home. Mr.
				and Mrs. Hans immigrated to Canada and found themselves with limited
				options for food that was part of their upbringing in a little
				village in India. They wanted to give back to the community that
				welcomed them to their new home and soon found a demand from the
				growing ethnic community that was not being met.</p>
			<p class="wcont">Mr. and Mrs. Hans took it upon themselves to
				create authentic Indian products that tasted just like the food they
				grew up with. To start, they were the first to ever make Dahi in
				Canada, an Indian style yogurt and they soon followed this up with a
				strong Indian influenced product line consisting of Lassi, a yogurt
				drink; Kheer, a rice pudding; and Makhan, a whipped butter. Hans
				Dairyâ€™s latest authentic products include a fruit flavoured yogurt
				line available in five local and exotic fruits catering to various
				palettes. Hans Dairy began supplying the Greater Toronto Area and
				with their daughters at the helm of the business, they have grown to
				meet the demand all across Canada.</p>
			<p class="wcont">With close to two decades of service, Hans Dairy
				has developed a strong reputation and relationship with the
				community. We thrive on customer satisfaction thus giving us the
				motivation to provide the best quality and most authentic dairy
				products on the market.</p>

				<div class="right_section_66">In accordance with our 100%
					natural philosophy, our products are free of any artificial sugars,
					flavourings, colourings, and preservatives. Take a look at the
					ingredients list and youâ€™ll find we put a lot of thought into what
					we put into our products because we want it to be as close to fresh
					and natural as possible. Youâ€™ll also find that our shelf life is
					not as long as the other guys because we donâ€™t focus on using
					ingredients that increase the shelf life. Instead, our primary goal
					is creating a natural product with milk and real fruit instead of
					modified milk ingredients and artificial flavourings that mimic the
					real taste. Hans Dairy products are stamped with the 100% Canadian
					Milk symbol which guarantees that our products are made from 100%
					Canadian cowâ€™s milk. Itâ€™s a guarantee that youâ€™re getting excellent
					quality and purity and youâ€™re also supporting Canadian dairy
					farmers. All our products are developed in-house using fresh
					ingredients and traditional techniques to ensure that great taste
					you love so you donâ€™t have to look too far for natural goodness.</div>

					At Hans Dairy, we pour our heart and soul into making products that
					we would feed our own family so itâ€™s our mission to make healthy
					products so you can feel confident feeding your family. We think
					about what our grandparents and parents put on the kitchen table
					and we want to ensure we carry on that tradition by putting clean
					and authentic products on your table. Growing up, we watched our
					mom make Dahi from scratch and learned the technique used across
					households in India. We want to share the love we have for the
					taste you get with homemade products and we do just that with all
					our product lines. Whether youâ€™re on the go or cooking for your
					loved ones, we take great pride in offering healthy and nutritious
					options that fit into your everyday life. Hans Dairy Yogurt
					Smoothies have the Foodland Ontario symbol which means all the
					ingredients, such as the milk and fruit are sourced locally in
					Ontario. Every time you buy local, youâ€™re choosing fresh, delicious
					food and building a strong sense of community. Buying local also
					means your food comes from closer to home, the closer, the fresher
					and the better option for your family. <br />
